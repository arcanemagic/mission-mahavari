# Mission Mahavari

Mission Mahavari is a video game I developed to spread awareness about menstrual hygiene and fight against the social taboos surrounding menstruation. This project is aimed towards helping underprivileged girls between the ages of 12-15.

After creating the game using Blender and Unity, I was ready to take it to the masses. I partnered with several organisations like Shakti-Shalini, Sadrag, Room to Read, and the Inner Wheel Club of Delhi to conduct workshops in government schools and women's shelters.
